# This is an environment to install orthoseg on native windows with GPU support.
#
# Notes:
#   - tensorflow is installed via pip as conda-forge does not provide packages for
#     windows.
#   - the minimal version of tensorflow is 2.10, as this is the last version with GPU
#     support on windows.
