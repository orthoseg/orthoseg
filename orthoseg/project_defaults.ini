# principle:
#   * an encoder: a (deep) neural network that detects features on object level
#   * a decoder: a (deep) neural network that converts the detected features 
#     on object level to a segmentation on pixel level
#
# To configure an encoder/decoder architecture in orthoseg, specify the it in 
# the following way: architecture = {encoder}+{decoder}
#
# There are a lot of encoders and decoders supported.
# For starters, the following encoder/decoder combinations are available:
#   * decoder: unet
#   * encoder: unet, ternaus 
# In the configuration, this can be specified as such, eg.:
#   * architecture = standard+unet
#
# Additionally, all encoders/decoders as provided by the 'segmentation_models'
# project (https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models#models-and-backbones) 
# can be used. 
# In the configuration below, use the "backbone" as encoder, and the "model"
