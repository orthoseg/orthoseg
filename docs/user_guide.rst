==========
User guide
==========

The main objective of orthoseg is to make it accessible to automatically digitize
features on orthophotos. This manual will guide you through the process of setting up a
new project, creating a training dataset, training a neural network and running a
prediction on an orthophoto.


Run sample project  
------------------

Once the installation of orthoseg and its dependencies is completed, you can run the
sample project included. The sample project is an easy way to get started and should
give a good idea on how you can start your own segmentation project. 

It contains:

* a training dataset that can be used to train a network to detect football fields
* a sample of the basic configuration for a typical project
* a sample of the default directory structure used by orthoseg
* a QGIS project file with the training data + aerial images that will be used to train
  the neural network + to detect football fields on

Remark: the training data included is meant to show how the process works, not to give
perfect, or even decent, results.

Running the sample project is easy. If the installation was successful, the following
steps should do the trick: 

1. start a conda command prompt
2. activate the orthoseg environment with::

    conda activate orthoseg

3. download the sample projects from orthoseg. You can specify the base location to
   download the sample projects to, but in this tutorial I'll assume "~" (= your home
   directory) for simplicity::

    orthoseg_load_sampleprojects ~

4. preload the images so they are ready to detect the football fields on, using the
   sample configurations file "footballfields.ini_BEFL-2019"::
   
    orthoseg_load_images --config ~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini

5. for the footballfields sample project, a pretrained neural network was downloaded in
   step orthoseg_load_sampleprojects to avoid having to train it. But, normally you
   would now train the neural network with the following command::

    orthoseg_train --config ~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini

6. detect the football fields::

    orthoseg_predict --config ~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini

Now, the directory `~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/output_vector` will
contain a .gpkg file with the football fields found.

An interesting exercise might be to detect football fields on another layer (on another
location). To get reasonable results, this should be a layer with 0.25 meter pixel size,
as this was the pixel size the footballfields detection was trained on. It's best to
first read `Prepare a new project`_ for some background information and then you could
try the following steps:

1. add the layer you want to predict on to the `imagelayer.ini` config file 
2. make a copy of `footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini` and change the `predict image_layer`
   parameter in the file to point to the new layer::

    [predict]
    image_layer = BEFL-2019

3. run `orthoseg_load_images` to prepare the layer to predict on::

   orthoseg_load_images --config ~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini

4. run the detection again with `orthoseg_predict`::

   orthoseg_predict --config ~/orthoseg/sample_projects/footballfields/footballfields_BEFL-2019.ini


Prepare a new project
---------------------

A few technical steps need to be taken to prepare a new segmentation project.

1. Only once: prepare "projects" directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If this is your very first orthoseg project, you need to prepare a directory where you
want to put your orthoseg projects. In the rest of the documentation we'll refer to this
directory as `{projects_dir}`.

It doesn't really matter where this directory is located, but these are examples that
can give you some inspiration:

* on linux: `~/orthoseg/projects` 
* on windows: `c:/users/{username}/orthoseg/projects`

The easiest way to create it is by starting from a copy of the
`sample_projects <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/tree/main/sample_projects>`_
directory to eg. your personal `orthoseg` directory and rename it to `projects`.

This way your projects directory immediately contains:

* an `imagelayers.ini` file (with sample content)
* a `project_defaults_overrule.ini` file (with sample content)
* the `project_template` directory: the template for a new segmentation project

2. Add the layer(s) you want to segment on to the image layer configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration for the image layers is located in `{projects_dir}/imagelayers.ini`.

Layers can be a local file, a WMS server, WMTS server or an XYZ server. The basic
structure of this configuration file is as follows: every section in the .ini file
(eg. `[BEFL-2019]`) contains the configuration of one `image layer`. In later steps of
this tutorial you well need to use the "image layer names" (for these examples
`BEFL-2019` and `BEFL-2020`), they are referred to with `{image_layer_name}`::

    # In this file, the image layers we can use in segmentations are configured. 

    [BEFL-2019]
    # Configuration info of this layer
    ...

    [BEFL-2020]
    # Configuration info of this layer
    ...


A more elaborate example that can be used as a template for the configuration can be
found here: `imagelayers.ini <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/blob/main/sample_projects/imagelayers.ini>`_.

3. Project name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a new name for the segmentation project: par example 'greenhouses', 'trees',
'buildings',... In the rest of the manual the project name will be refered to with
`{segment_subject}`.

4. Prepare "project" directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For your new segmentation project, make a copy of the `project_template` directory to
`{projects_dir}` and rename it to `{segment_subject}`.

5. Prepare project settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rename the project file in the new project directory from `projectfile.ini` to
`{segment_subject}.ini`. In the file you should at least change the following
parameter:::

    [general]
    segment_subject = {segment_subject}


As you might have recognized from the small section above, orthoseg uses the good old
.ini file format for its configuration, with "ExtendedInterpolation". General
information about this file format can be found here:
`ConfigParser-ExtendeInterpolation <https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/configparser.html#interpolation-of-values>`_.

The configuration can be found + modified in the following files: 

1. All existing sections and parameters + their **default values** can be found in the
   following file: `orthoseg_install_dir/orthoseg/project_defaults.ini <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/blob/main/orthoseg/project_defaults.ini>`_.
   It is highly recommended not to change anything in this file, as it will be
   overwritten when installing a new version of orthoseg anyway. But if you want to
   overrule any setting, this is the perfect spot to find all existing sections +
   parameters and copy/paste the section + parameter to one of the next files and change
   the value there to overrule it for your project(s).
2. If you want to **overrule** a parameter for all the projects in your project
   directory, add the section + parameter to the `project_defaults_overrule.ini` file in
   your projects directory, eg:
   `{projects_dir}/project_defaults_overrule.ini <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/blob/main/sample_projects/project_defaults_overrule.ini>`_.
3. If you want to **overrule** parameters for a specific project, you can do so in the
   project-specific config file: eg.
   `{projects_dir}/{segment_subject}/{segment_subject}.ini <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/blob/main/sample_projects/project_template/projectfile.ini>`_.

6. Configure image layer(s)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the image layers you want to train/predict on aren't configured yet, configure them
in `{projects_dir}/imagelayers.ini <https://github.com/orthoseg/orthoseg/blob/main/sample_projects/imagelayers.ini>`_,
the same way as the default layers provided.

7. Prepare training data files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The labels folder in the new project folder contains two .gpkg files where training
examples can be added to as explained in the following page of this manual. The file
names should have the following structure: 

* {segment_subject}_{image_layer_name}_locations.gpkg 
* {segment_subject}_{image_layer_name}_polygons.gpkg 

If you want to create one segmentation with training examples based on multiple image
layers, you can create a seperate pair of .gpkg files per image layer.

8. Prepare GIS project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start your prefered GIS application (eg. QGIS), and create a new project. Add the .gpkg
files from the labels directory and add the layers you want to digitize the training
examples on (eg. BEFL-2019). 

It is practical to create a layer group per image layer you want to train data on with:

   * the 2 corresponding .gpkg files
   * the image layer (eg. BEFL-2019)

Save the project to the project directory.


Create training data
--------------------

General info
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use any GIS tool you want to create the training data, as long as it can edit
.gpkg files. I personally use QGIS on a windows computer, but even though in some cases
I might give specific instructions based on the environment I use, I'm sure valid
alternatives exist using any other GIS tool on eg. linux.

Before you start digitizing examples, it is a good idea to put a definition of the
subject you want to segment on paper, with a clear scope of things you want to include
or want to exclude. While you are busy creating your training dataset this might still
evolve based on examples you encounter and didn't think of at this stage, but as it is
important that the training dataset is consequent, make sure the definition is/stays
clear.

The orthoseg training data is (by default) organized as follows. In your `{project_dir}`
there is a directory called `labels`. In this directory there should be 2 files per
image layer that you want to use to base your training on:

* {segment_subject}_{image_layer_name}_locations.gpkg
* {segment_subject}_{image_layer_name}_polygons.gpkg

In the `locations`` file you need to draw the bounding boxes of the images that will be
downloaded and used as the images to train the detection on. In the `polygons`` file you
need to digitize the things you want to detect as polygons as shown in the screenshot
below. The green square is the `location`, the red rectangle is the `polygon` drawn to
show where the football field is in the `location`. This training example will help the
neural network to learn how a (part of a) football field looks, but also that tennis
fields are not to be detected...

   :alt: Digitize training data, location and polygon

Creating training data is -in my experience- an iterative process. You add some samples
to the training dataset, you evaluate the results, add some more,... This way you can
minimize the number of training samples you need to digitize/train on which can save a
lot of time.

So, the following steps need to be iterated over till you are happy with the results:

Search for good examples and add them to the training input
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are different strategies possible to find good examples to add to the training
input:

1. On random locations
""""""""""""""""""""""

For the initial examples, you can use an existing dataset to find relevant locations or
just zoom to random locations distributed over the territory you want to segment. 

2. Use the vectorized result of a prediction on the entire territory
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a run has been done on the entire territory, a vectorized file of the segmentation
will be available. Using this, there are several options to look for new examples using
it:

1. Do overlays with existing datasets that can help to find missing examples.
2. Check locations in a random way distributed on the territory to find segmentation
   errors.
3. In the vector file of the segmentation result, a column "nbcoords" will be available.
   Order this column descending to find the polygons with the most points: often these
   polygons with many points are bad segmentations.

3. Use the result of a previous training run
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you already did a training run, it is often useful to look for errors in the training
data. After training, orthoseg will automatically run an "evaluation" prediction on all
the images in the training, validation and test datasets. This won't be saved as a
vector file, but these predictions will be saved as images in the following directories:

  * {project_dir}/training/{traindata_version}/train/{segment_subject}_..._eval
  * {project_dir}/training/{traindata_version}/validation/{segment_subject}_..._eval
  * {project_dir}/training/{traindata_version}/test/{segment_subject}_..._eval

Each of these directories is useful to look at in the following way:

  * If you open the directory with the predictions and set the view in eg.
    "Windows explorer" to "large tiles", you will see the original image, followed by
    the mask and by the prediction, so you can easily compare them.
  * The file names of the predictions are formatted this way:
    `<prediction_quality>_<x_min>_<y_min>_<x_max>_<y_max>_<nb_pix_x>_<nb_pix_y>_<image_type>.tif`

      * `<prediction_quality>`: is the percentage overlap between the mask (as digitized
        in the training dataset) and the prediction, so examples with problems will have
        a small percentage overlap and will be shown first in the directory.
      * `<x_min>,...`: these are the coordinates of the location of the image. So if you
        want to correct a digitization of an image in eg. QGIS, you can:

         1. copy/paste the `<x_min>_<y_min>` to the "coordinate" field the status bar
            (below) in QGIS
         2. replace the "_" by ","
         3. press the ENTER key, and you'll be in the right location.

      * <image_type>: 'mask' for the digitized mask, 'pred' for the prediction,...

4. Add good examples found to the training dataset
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The way you digitize the examples in the training dataset will influence the quality of
the result significantly, so here is some advice:

   * Digitize the examples for the training process as precise as you want the result
     to be.
   * If you need relatively complex interpretation yourself to deduct things from the
     image, the AI probably won't succeed in doing it... yet. An example of something I
     didn't get good results with:

      * A road that goes into a forest and comes out of it a bit further might be logic
        to a human that it will probably continue under the trees, but this didn't work
        in my quick tests.

   * If you want detailed results, make sure you digitize the examples on the same ortho
     imagery you are going to train the network on. Certainly for subjects that have a
     certain height (eg. buildings, trees,...) a significant translation of eg. the roof
     can occur between different acquisitions that can influence the accuracy. 
   * With the default parameters, the training works on images of 512x512 pixels and the
     prediction on 2304x2304. So the AI won't be able to take into account more
     information than available on those images. So if you need to zoom out and look on
     larger area's than those, take in account the AI won't have this option.

If you find good examples, you can add them to the training dataset as such:

1. First, add the location that will be used to determine the extent of the image to the
   `{subject}_{image_layer_name}_locations` file. The bounding box of the image
   generated for the training process will be the minx and miny of the bounding box of
   the polygon digitized. The width and height of the image are determined by the pixel
   width and pixel height as defined in the configuration files. Par example, using the
   default pixel width and height of 512 pixels, and a pixel size of 0.25 meter/pixel
   the image width and height will be 128 meter (512 pixels * 0.25 meter/pixel). The
   location polygon should be digitized at least the size the generated image will be,
   so it is clear for which area you need to digitize the exact labeled polygons in the
   next step. During the training step the locations will be validated and if (some of
   them) are too small, an error will be given. The 
   `Advanced digitizing panel <https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/editing_geometry_attributes.html#the-advanced-digitizing-panel>`_
   in QGIS makes it quite trivial to digitize them with the correct size.

   You need to fill out the following properties for each location:

   * traindata_type (text): determines how the image generated based on this location
     will be used in the training. Possible values: 'train', 'validation', 'test',
     'todo'.

      * locations set to 'train' will actually be used to train the AI on. 
      * locations set to 'validation' will be used during the training to crosscheck if
        the AI is sufficiently learning in a general way so it will be working well on
        data it has never seen before instead of specializing on the specific cases in
        the 'train' locations. The best results are obtained if 10% to 20% of the
        locations are set to 'validation' and try to focus on as many different common
        examples as possible, but evade including difficult situations in the
        'validation', only set those to 'train'. 
      * optionally, you can set locations to 'test': they won't be used in the training
        process, but after the training run the segmentation will be applied to them,
        including reporting. Eg. if you have an existing dataset with examples of
        moderate quality or if you encounter situations you are not sure about, you can
        set them to 'test'.
      * optionally, you can set locations to 'todo': they won't be used at all, but this
        class is practical to signify that the location still needs work: eg. the
        polygons still need to be digitized.

   * description (text): optional: a description of the label location


   Remark:

   * train images can't/won't overlap: when looping through the locations digitized, if
     an image location overlaps with an already generated image, it will be skipped.

2. If you are adding a 'false positive', so a location where the segmentation thinks the
   subject is present on this location, but it isn't, you are already ready and can look
   for another example.
3. If you are adding a 'false negative', or any new example, now you need to digitize
   the actual subject in the `{subject}_labeldata` file. It is important to digitize all
   samples of the subject in the location area added in the previous step, as any
   surface that isn't digitized will be treated (and trained) as a 'false positive'. 

   The following properties need to be filled out:

     * label_name (text): the content of the label data digitized. The label names you
       can use are defined in the subjects configuration file. If it is different than
       the ones specified there, it will be ignored.
     * description (text): optional: a description of the feature digitized.


Run training + (optionally) a (full) prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instructions to run a train, predict,... session can be found in the next section.


Run train, predict,... session
------------------------------

Once you have added a meaningful number of (extra) examples, you can do a (new) training
run. The number of added examples that is meaningful will depend on the case, but a
reasonable amount is 50.
Once the model is trained, you can continue by running a prediction and if wanted a
postprocessing step.

If you ran the sample project, these steps will look very familiar:

1. start a conda command prompt

2. activate the orthoseg environment with::
   
   conda activate orthoseg


3. preload the images so they are ready to detect your `{segment_subject}` on, using the
   configuration file `{project_dir}{segment_subject}.ini`::
   
   orthoseg_load_images --config {project_dir}{segment_subject}.ini


4. train a neural network to detect football fields::
   
   orthoseg_train --config {project_dir}{segment_subject}.ini


5. detect the football fields::

   orthoseg_predict --config {project_dir}{segment_subject}.ini


After this completes, the directory `{project_dir}/output_vector` will contain a .gpkg
file with the features found.

Of course it is also possible to script this in your scripting language of choice to
automate this further...

Remark:
^^^^^^^
Because tasks often take quite a while, orthoseg maximally tries to resume work that
was started but was not finished yet. Eg. when predicting a large area, OrthoSeg will
save the prediction per image, so if the prediction process is stopped for any reason
and restarted, it will continue where it stopped.
